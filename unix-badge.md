# Unix Badge Notes

Using the `-exec` of the `find` command you can grep for any `check` keywords
throughout the filesystem

```sh
find /home -name .bashrc -exec grep [PATTERN] {} \;
```

Where `[PATTERN]` should be replaced by the pattern you're searching for.

Searching for calls to the `passwd` will retrieve too many lines as our `grep`
will also match lines containing `/etc/passwd`. We can ask `grep` to only match
the lines **starting** with passed by using `^`:

```sh
find /home -name .bash_history -exec grep -A 1 '^passwd' {} \;
```
