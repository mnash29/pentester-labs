# Unix Badge Notes

Using the `-exec` of the `find` command you can grep for any `check` keywords
throughout the filesystem

```sh
find /home -name .bashrc -exec grep [PATTERN] {} \;
```

Where `[PATTERN]` should be replaced by the pattern you're searching for.

Searching for calls to the `passwd` will retrieve too many lines as our `grep`
will also match lines containing `/etc/passwd`. We can ask `grep` to only match
the lines **starting** with passed by using `^`:

```sh
find /home -name .bash_history -exec grep -A 1 '^passwd' {} \;
```

Administrators often use `/tmp` to leave files they want cleaned up after each
reboot. Files with `.tgz` extension are `tar` archives that have been 
compressed with the `gzip` command. Decompress the archive using the `-d` flag:

```sh
gzip -d [FILE_NAME]
```

Administrators often leave files in the `/var/tmp` directory as it does not
get cleanup up after each reboot. Files with `.tgz` extension is a tar archive
that has been compressed using `bzip`. Decompress the archive with the `-d` flag:

```sh
bzip2 -d [FILE_NAME]
```

Encryption/Decryption with `openssl` and key

```sh
# Encrypt file
openssl enc -aed256 -in [INFILE_NAME] -out [OUTFILE_NAME] -k [PASS_KEY]

# Decrypt file
openssl enc -aed256 -d -in [INFILE_NAME] -out [OUTFILE_NAME] -k [PASS_KEY]
```
